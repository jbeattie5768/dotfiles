# dotfiles\win_setup

## Chicken and Egg

For a new setup you need 2 things:

1. The files on your local machine
   1. Copy the files from GitHub to your local machine
      * `.\dotfiles\win_setup\install\install_apps.ps1`
      * `.\dotfiles\win_setup\install\choco_apps.cfg`
   2. Or install Git manually and clone the repo
      * `winget install --id=Git.Git  -e`
2. Powershell to run the Scripts
   1. Win11 comes with the basic PS, that should be enough to get started
   2. Or install manually
      * `winget install --id=Microsoft.PowerShell.Preview  -e`

For Chocolatey, the PS1 script will try to install or upgrade Chocolatey. Otherwise install manually: `winget install --id=Chocolatey.Chocolatey  -e`

## dotfiles\win_setup\install

`choco_apps.cfg`                       # Apps to be installed via Choco  
`.\win_setup\install\install_apps.ps1` # Powershell script to install apps for new Windows PC  

By default the `install_apps.ps1` script will install application via Chocolatey listed in the `.win_setup\install\choco_apps.cfg` file.  
You can pass al alternative application file to the sctipt via the `-ConfigFile` argument, e.g., :

`.\win_setup\install\install_apps.ps1 -ConfigFile c:\temp\my_choco_apps.txt`

If you pass a custom ConfigFile, it must be in the same format as the default, i.e., `[package_name <optional_params>]`. In addition, each line of the ConfigFile file needs to be one of the following:

* Empty
* Starts with #
* Starts with [

There are further optional arguments for the scripts, mainly used for Debug/Test purposes. The defaults are:

* `-DisableChoco $false`
* `-DisableWinget $false`
* `-DisableWSL $false`

See the PS1 script for their use, but basically if enabled they disable the install of that section of the script.

## dotfiles\win_setup\config

`.\win_setup\config\config_win.ps1`    # Map local drives and setup File Explorer as I like it  
`map_local_drive.bat`                  # Map Local Drives Batch file to link from
